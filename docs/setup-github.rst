Setup Github
============
.. _setup-github:

If you already have a Github account and organization for your company, you can skip this.

Don't worry too much about an "official" GitHub account---it's very easy to transfer the ownership of a GitHub organization to another account in the future.

You don't need to sign up for any paid tier (Team, Enterprise, etc.). This can all be done within the free tier.
